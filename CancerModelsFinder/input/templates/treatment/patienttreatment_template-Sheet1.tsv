#Description	Unique anonymous/de-identified provider ID for the patient	"treatment name, can be surgery, radotherapy,  drug name  or drug combination ( (radiotherapy, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, homorno-therapy))"	Treatment dose and unit	treatement starting date in month and year - this data will be transformed in tretamenet event sequences and no dates which are potentially sensitive will appear on the public PDX finder	treatment duration 	"IF DATES ARE ENTERED IN PREVIOUS COLUMN  - DON'T FILL,- treatment event order event 1 correspond to the 1st time a patient was  treated to generate a PDX, subsequent events are incremented by 1 "	"IF TREATMENT DATES ARE ENTERED IN PREVIOUS COLUMNS  - DON'T FILL, if not please provide the time difference between the 1st  event and the current one (in month unit preferably or indicate the units) - treatment event 1 should be 0, treatment event 2 should be 6 if 6 months have elapased between event 1 and  event 2 and treatment event 3 should be 9 if 9 months have elapsed between event 1 and  3 "	reponse of prior treatment treatment	classification used to define response to treatment 	Unique identifier for PDX when treatment was concomitant with PDX creation.
